### Problem 1:
Ask the user for a number. Print from 0 to the user input.

### Problem 2:
Create a program that takes user input in a while loop. If they enter 1, print 1. If they enter 2, print 2. If they enter 3 print 3. If they enter ‘q’ or 0 (your choice), quit. Else, print “ERROR”.

### Problem 3:
Create a program that takes the user input until they enter 'q'. You should store all of their input and separate the input with a comma. Once they enter 'q', print all of the comma separated words they entered.
